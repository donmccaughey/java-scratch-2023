# `hello`

This is a classic "Hello world!" command line application.  There's a single
source file under the `src/` directory.  The `Makefile` has targets to compile
Java source files to `.class` files and to run the application, demonstrating
the use of the `javac` compiler and `java` command to start the JVM.
