# Java Scratch 2023

It's been fifteen years since I've done any significant work in Java.  This 
repo is a collection of toy projects to help me get up to speed on the modern
Java ecosystem, including Java 21, Maven, Spring and Spring Boot.

## Projects

- [`hello`](./hello) - a "Hello world!" command line app
- [`igpay`](./igpay) - a command line Pig Latin translator
- [`migpay`](./migpay) - the `igpay` app with a Maven build system
